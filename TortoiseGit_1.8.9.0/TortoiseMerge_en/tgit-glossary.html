				A Git command that is used to add a
				file or directory to your working tree.
				The new items are added to the repository when you commit.
			</p></dd><dt>BASE revision</dt><dd><p>
				The current base revision of a file or folder in your <span class="emphasis"><em>working tree</em></span>. 
				This is the revision the file or folder was in, when the last checkout,
				update or commit was run. The BASE revision is normally not equal to the
				HEAD revision.
			</p></dd><dt>Blame</dt><dd><p>
				This command is for text files only, and it annotates every line to
				show the repository revision in which it was last changed, and the
				author who made that change. Our GUI implementation is called
				TortoiseGitBlame and it also shows the commit date/time and the
				log message when you hover the mouse of the revision number.
			</p></dd><dt>Branch</dt><dd><p>
				A term frequently used in revision control systems to describe
				what happens when development forks at a particular point and
				follows 2 separate paths. You can create a branch off the main
				development line so as to develop a new feature without rendering
				the main line unstable. Or you can branch a stable release to which
				you make only bug fixes, while new developments take place on the
				unstable trunk. In Git a branch is implemented as a
				<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pointer to a revision</span>&#8221;</span>.
			</p></dd><dt>Cleanup</dt><dd><p>
				Remove untracked files from the working tree.
			</p><p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>This is different to TortoiseSVN cleanup</em></span>
			</p></dd><dt>Clone</dt><dd><p>
				A Git command which creates a local working tree in an empty
				directory by downloading a remote repository.
			</p></dd><dt>Commit</dt><dd><p>
				This Git command is used to pass the changes in your local
				working tree back into the repository, creating a new repository
				revision.
			</p></dd><dt>Conflict</dt><dd><p>
				When changes from the repository are merged with local changes, 
				sometimes those changes occur on the same lines. In this case
				Git cannot automatically decide which version to use and
				the file is said to be in conflict. You have to edit the file manually
				and resolve the conflict before you can commit any further changes.
			</p></dd><dt>Copy</dt><dd><p>
				In a Git repository you can create a copy of a single file
				or an entire tree.
			</p></dd><dt>Delete</dt><dd><p>
				When you delete a versioned item (and commit the change) the item
				no longer exists in the repository after the committed revision.
				But of course it still exists in earlier repository revisions,
				so you can still access it. If necessary, you can copy a deleted
				item and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resurrect</span>&#8221;</span> it complete with history.
			</p></dd><dt>Diff</dt><dd><p>
				Shorthand for <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Show Differences</span>&#8221;</span>. Very useful when
				you want to see exactly what changes have been made.
			</p></dd><dt>Export</dt><dd><p>
				This command produces an compressed archive of all versioned files (of a specific revision).
			</p></dd><dt>GPO</dt><dd><p>
				Group policy object
			</p></dd><dt>HEAD revision</dt><dd><p>
				The latest revision of a file or folder in the <span class="emphasis"><em>repository</em></span>.
			</p></dd><dt>History</dt><dd><p>
				Show the revision history of a file or folder.
				Also known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Log</span>&#8221;</span>.
			</p></dd><dt>Log</dt><dd><p>
				Show the revision history of a file or folder.
				Also known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">History</span>&#8221;</span>.
			</p></dd><dt>Merge</dt><dd><p>
				The process by which changes from the repository are added to your
				working tree without disrupting any changes you have already made
				locally. Sometimes these changes cannot be reconciled automatically
				and the working tree is said to be in conflict.
			</p><p>
				Merging happens automatically when you update your working tree.
				You can also merge specific changes from another branch using
				TortoiseGit's Merge command.
			</p></dd><dt>Patch</dt><dd><p>
				If a working tree has changes to text files only, it is possible
				to use Git's Diff command to generate a single file summary
				of those changes in Unified Diff format. A file of this type is often
				referred to as a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Patch</span>&#8221;</span>, and it can be emailed to someone
				else (or to a mailing list) and applied to another working tree.
				Someone without commit access can make changes and submit a patch
				file for an authorized committer to apply. Or if you are unsure about
				a change you can submit a patch for others to review.
			</p></dd><dt>Repository</dt><dd><p>
				A repository is a place where data is stored and maintained. 
				A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for 
				distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is 
				directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network.
				Git is a distributed version control system.
				A Git repository does not require network to work with most operations.
				Network is required only when you need to synchronize changes with remote repositories.
			</p></dd><dt>Resolve</dt><dd><p>
				When files in a working tree are left in a conflicted state following
				a merge, those conflicts must be sorted out by a human using an editor
				(or perhaps TortoiseGitMerge). This process is referred to as
				<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Resolving Conflicts</span>&#8221;</span>. When this is complete you can mark
				the conflicted files as being resolved, which allows them to be committed.
			</p></dd><dt>Revert</dt><dd><p>
				If you have made changes
				and decide you want to undo them, you can use the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">revert</span>&#8221;</span>
				command to go back to the version from HEAD.
			</p></dd><dt>Revision</dt><dd><p>
				Every time you commit a set of changes, you create one new
				<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">revision</span>&#8221;</span> in the repository. Each revision represents
				the state of the repository tree at a certain point in its history.
				If you want to go back in time you can examine the repository as
				it was at revision N.
			</p><p>
				In another sense, a revision can refer to the set of changes that
				were made when that revision was created.
			</p></dd><dt>SVN</dt><dd><p>
				A frequently-used abbreviation for Subversion.
			</p><p>
				TortoiseGit provides git-svn interoperability.
				You can fetch partial or whole history from an SVN remote and store as a local git repository.
				This allows you to browse the history and create commits locally.
				You can finally commit your changes to an SVN remote.
			</p></dd><dt>Switch/Checkout</dt><dd><p>
				Just as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Update-to-revision</span>&#8221;</span> changes the time
				window of a working tree to look at a different point in history,
				so <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Switch</span>&#8221;</span> changes the space window of a working tree
				so that it points to a different part of the repository.
				It is particularly useful when working on master and branches where
				only a few files differ. You can switch your working tree between
				the two and only the changed files will be updated.
			</p></dd><dt>Update</dt><dd><p>
				This Git command pulls down the latest changes from the
				repository into your working tree, merging any changes made by
				others with local changes in the working tree.
			</p></dd><dt>Working Copy</dt><dd><p>
				See <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Working Tree</span>&#8221;</span>.
			</p></dd><dt>Working Tree</dt><dd><p>
				This is your local <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sandbox</span>&#8221;</span>, the area where you
				work on the versioned files, and it normally resides on your
				local hard disk. You create a working tree by doing a
				<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Clone</span>&#8221;</span> of a repository, and you feed your
				changes back into the repository using <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Commit</span>&#8221;</span>.
