			Now that you have checked out a working tree from a Git
			repository you can see your files in the windows explorer with
			changed icons. This is one of the reasons why TortoiseGit is so
			popular. TortoiseGit adds a so called overlay icon to each
			file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending on
			the Git status of the file the overlay icon is different.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/InGitIcon.png"></div><p>
			A fresh checked out working tree has a green checkmark as overlay.
			That means the Git status is <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span>.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ModifiedIcon.png"></div><p>
			As soon as you start editing a file,
			the status changes to <span class="emphasis"><em>modified</em></span>
			and the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation
			mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed
			since you last updated your working tree and need to be committed.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ConflictIcon.png"></div><p>
			If during an update a <span class="emphasis"><em>conflict</em></span> occurs then
			the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ReadOnlyIcon.png"></div><p> 
			Staged. If you use "git update-index" to tell git this file will be committed,
			Git makes that file staged.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/DeletedIcon.png"></div><p> 
			This icon shows you that some files or folders inside the current folder
			have been scheduled to be <span class="emphasis"><em>deleted</em></span> from version control
			or a file under version control is missing in a folder.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/AddedIcon.png"></div><p> 
			The plus sign tells you that a file or folder has been scheduled to be
			<span class="emphasis"><em>added</em></span> to version control.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/IgnoredIcon.png"></div><p> 
			The bar sign tells you that a file or folder is
			<span class="emphasis"><em>ignored</em></span> for version control purposes.
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/UnversionedIcon.png"></div><p> 
			This icon shows files and folders which are not under version control,
			but have not been ignored.
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			In fact, you may find that not all of these icons are used on your system.
			This is because the number of overlays allowed by Windows is very limited
			and if you are also using an old version of TortoiseCVS, then there are
			not enough overlay slots available.
			TortoiseGit tries to be a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Good Citizen (TM)</span>&#8221;</span>
			and limits its use of overlays to give other apps a chance too.
		</p><p>
			Now that there are more Tortoise clients around (TortoiseCVS, TortoiseHG, ...)
			the icon limit becomes a real problem. To work around this, the TortoiseSVN
			project introduced a common shared icon set, loaded as a DLL, which can be
			used by all Tortoise clients. Check with your client provider to see if
			this has been integrated yet :-)
		</p><p>

			status and other technical details, read

			It's often very useful to know which files you have
			changed and also which files got changed and
			committed by others. That's where the command
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Check For Modifications...</span>
			comes in handy.
			This dialog will show you every file that has changed in any
			way in your working tree, as well as any unversioned files
			you may have.
		</p><p>
			The dialog uses colour coding to highlight the status.

			This is the default colour scheme, but you can customise those colours
			using the settings dialog.
			Read <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-colours" title="2.35.1.6. TortoiseGit Colour Settings">Section 2.35.1.6, &#8220;TortoiseGit Colour Settings&#8221;</a> for more information.
		</p><p>
			Items which have been switched to a different repository path are
			also indicated using an <code class="literal">(s)</code> marker. You may have
			switched something while working on a branch and forgotten to switch
			back to trunk. This is your warning sign!
		</p><p>
			From the context menu of the dialog you can show a diff of the
			changes. Check the local changes <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> made using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Compare with Base</span>.
			Check the changes in the repository made by others using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Show Differences as Unified Diff</span>.
		</p><p>
			You can also revert changes in individual files. If you have deleted
			a file accidentally, it will show up as <span class="emphasis"><em>Missing</em></span>
			and you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>Revert</em></span> to recover it.
		</p><p>
			Unversioned and ignored files can be sent to the recycle bin from here using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span>.
			If you want to delete files permanently (bypassing the recycle bin) hold
			the <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> key while clicking on <span class="guilabel">Delete</span>.
		</p><p>
			If you want to examine a file in detail, you can drag it from here
			into another application such as a text editor or IDE.
		</p><p>
			The columns are customizable. If you
			<span class="action">right click</span> on any column header you will see a
			context menu allowing you to select which columns are displayed.
			You can also change column width by using the drag handle which
			appears when you move the mouse over a column boundary. These
			customizations are preserved, so you will see the same headings
			next time.
		</p><p>
			At the bottom of the dialog you can see a summary of the range of repository
			revisions in use in your working tree. These are the <span class="emphasis"><em>commit</em></span>
			revisions, not the <span class="emphasis"><em>update</em></span> revisions; they represent the
			range of revisions where these files were last committed, not the revisions
			to which they have been updated. Note that the revision range shown applies
			only to the items displayed, not to the entire working tree. If you want to
			see that information for the whole working tree you must check the
			<span class="guilabel">Show unmodified files</span> checkbox.

				If you want a flat view of your working tree, i.e. showing all files
				and folders at every level of the folder hierarchy, then the
				<span class="guilabel">Check for Modifications</span> dialog is the

				<span class="guilabel">Show unmodified files</span> checkbox to show

			Often you want to look inside your files, to have a look at what
			you've changed. You can accomplish this by selecting a file which
			has changed, and selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Diff</span> from
			TortoiseGit's context menu. This starts the external
			diff-viewer, which will then compare the current file with the
			pristine copy (<code class="literal">BASE</code> revision), which was stored
			after the last checkout or update.

				Even when not inside a working tree or when you have multiple
				versions of the file lying around, you can still display diffs:
			</p><p>
				Select the two files you want to compare in explorer
				(e.g. using <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> and the mouse) and
				choose <span class="guimenuitem">Diff</span> from TortoiseGit's
				context menu. The file clicked last (the one with the focus,
				i.e. the dotted rectangle) will be regarded as the later
				one.
