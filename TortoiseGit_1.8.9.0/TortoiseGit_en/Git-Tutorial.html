changes to it, and share changes with other developers.</p><p>If you are instead primarily interested in using git to fetch a project,
for example, to test the latest version, you may prefer to start with
the first two chapters of link:user-manual.html[The Git User's Manual].</p><p>First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as
<span class="emphasis"><em>git log --graph</em></span> with:</p><pre class="screen">$ man git-log</pre><p>or:</p><pre class="screen">$ git help log</pre><p>With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see
<a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-help(1)" title="G.3.56. git-help(1)">Section G.3.56, &#8220;git-help(1)&#8221;</a> for more information.</p><p>It is a good idea to introduce yourself to git with your name and
public email address before doing any operation.  The easiest
way to do so is:</p><pre class="screen">$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com</pre></div><div class="simplesect" title="Importing a new project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__importing_a_new_project"></a>Importing a new project</h4></div></div></div><p>Assume you have a tarball project.tar.gz with your initial work.  You
can place it under git revision control as follows.</p><pre class="screen">$ tar xzf project.tar.gz
$ cd project
$ git init</pre><p>Git will reply</p><pre class="screen">Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</pre><p>You've now initialized the working directory--you may notice a new
directory created, named ".git".</p><p>Next, tell git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the
current directory (note the <span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span>), with <span class="emphasis"><em>git add</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git add .</pre><p>This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which git calls
the "index".  You can permanently store the contents of the index in the
repository with <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit</pre><p>This will prompt you for a commit message.  You've now stored the first
version of your project in git.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Making changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__making_changes"></a>Making changes</h4></div></div></div><p>Modify some files, then add their updated contents to the index:</p><pre class="screen">$ git add file1 file2 file3</pre><p>You are now ready to commit.  You can see what is about to be committed
using <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff</em></span> with the --cached option:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff --cached</pre><p>(Without --cached, <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff</em></span> will show you any changes that
you've made but not yet added to the index.)  You can also get a brief
summary of the situation with <span class="emphasis"><em>git status</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       modified:   file1
#       modified:   file2
#       modified:   file3
#</pre><p>If you need to make any further adjustments, do so now, and then add any
newly modified content to the index.  Finally, commit your changes with:</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit</pre><p>This will again prompt you for a message describing the change, and then
record a new version of the project.</p><p>Alternatively, instead of running <span class="emphasis"><em>git add</em></span> beforehand, you can use</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit -a</pre><p>which will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add
them to the index, and commit, all in one step.</p><p>A note on commit messages: Though not required, it's a good idea to
begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character)
line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more
thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit
message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used
throughout git.  For example, <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-format-patch(1)" title="G.3.48. git-format-patch(1)">Section G.3.48, &#8220;git-format-patch(1)&#8221;</a> turns a
commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the
rest of the commit in the body.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Git tracks content not files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__git_tracks_content_not_files"></a>Git tracks content not files</h4></div></div></div><p>Many revision control systems provide an <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> command that tells the
system to start tracking changes to a new file.  Git's <span class="emphasis"><em>add</em></span> command
does something simpler and more powerful: <span class="emphasis"><em>git add</em></span> is used both for new
and newly modified files, and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the
given files and stages that content in the index, ready for inclusion in
the next commit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Viewing project history"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__viewing_project_history"></a>Viewing project history</h4></div></div></div><p>At any point you can view the history of your changes using</p><pre class="screen">$ git log</pre><p>If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use</p><pre class="screen">$ git log -p</pre><p>Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of
each step</p><pre class="screen">$ git log --stat --summary</pre></div><div class="simplesect" title="Managing branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__managing_branches"></a>Managing branches</h4></div></div></div><p>A single git repository can maintain multiple branches of
development.  To create a new branch named "experimental", use</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch experimental</pre><p>If you now run</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch</pre><p>you'll get a list of all existing branches:</p><pre class="screen">  experimental
* master</pre><p>The "experimental" branch is the one you just created, and the
"master" branch is a default branch that was created for you
automatically.  The asterisk marks the branch you are currently on;
type</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout experimental</pre><p>to switch to the experimental branch.  Now edit a file, commit the
change, and switch back to the master branch:</p><pre class="screen">(edit file)
$ git commit -a
$ git checkout master</pre><p>Check that the change you made is no longer visible, since it was
made on the experimental branch and you're back on the master branch.</p><p>You can make a different change on the master branch:</p><pre class="screen">(edit file)
$ git commit -a</pre><p>at this point the two branches have diverged, with different changes
made in each.  To merge the changes made in experimental into master, run</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge experimental</pre><p>If the changes don't conflict, you're done.  If there are conflicts,
markers will be left in the problematic files showing the conflict;</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff</pre><p>will show this.  Once you've edited the files to resolve the
conflicts,</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit -a</pre><p>will commit the result of the merge. Finally,</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk</pre><p>will show a nice graphical representation of the resulting history.</p><p>At this point you could delete the experimental branch with</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch -d experimental</pre><p>This command ensures that the changes in the experimental branch are
already in the current branch.</p><p>If you develop on a branch crazy-idea, then regret it, you can always
delete the branch with</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch -D crazy-idea</pre><p>Branches are cheap and easy, so this is a good way to try something
out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Using git for collaboration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__using_git_for_collaboration"></a>Using git for collaboration</h4></div></div></div><p>Suppose that Alice has started a new project with a git repository in
/home/alice/project, and that Bob, who has a home directory on the
same machine, wants to contribute.</p><p>Bob begins with:</p><pre class="screen">bob$ git clone /home/alice/project myrepo</pre><p>This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice's
repository.  The clone is on an equal footing with the original
project, possessing its own copy of the original project's history.</p><p>Bob then makes some changes and commits them:</p><pre class="screen">(edit files)
bob$ git commit -a
(repeat as necessary)</pre><p>When he's ready, he tells Alice to pull changes from the repository
at /home/bob/myrepo.  She does this with:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ cd /home/alice/project
alice$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master</pre><p>This merges the changes from Bob's "master" branch into Alice's
current branch.  If Alice has made her own changes in the meantime,
then she may need to manually fix any conflicts.</p><p>The "pull" command thus performs two operations: it fetches changes
from a remote branch, then merges them into the current branch.</p><p>Note that in general, Alice would want her local changes committed before
initiating this "pull".  If Bob's work conflicts with what Alice did since
their histories forked, Alice will use her working tree and the index to
resolve conflicts, and existing local changes will interfere with the
conflict resolution process (git will still perform the fetch but will
refuse to merge --- Alice will have to get rid of her local changes in
some way and pull again when this happens).</p><p>Alice can peek at what Bob did without merging first, using the "fetch"
command; this allows Alice to inspect what Bob did, using a special
symbol "FETCH_HEAD", in order to determine if he has anything worth
pulling, like this:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git fetch /home/bob/myrepo master
alice$ git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD</pre><p>This operation is safe even if Alice has uncommitted local changes.
The range notation "HEAD..FETCH_HEAD" means "show everything that is reachable
from the FETCH_HEAD but exclude anything that is reachable from HEAD".
Alice already knows everything that leads to her current state (HEAD),
and reviews what Bob has in his state (FETCH_HEAD) that she has not
seen with this command.</p><p>If Alice wants to visualize what Bob did since their histories forked
she can issue the following command:</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk HEAD..FETCH_HEAD</pre><p>This uses the same two-dot range notation we saw earlier with <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span>.</p><p>Alice may want to view what both of them did since they forked.
She can use three-dot form instead of the two-dot form:</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk HEAD...FETCH_HEAD</pre><p>This means "show everything that is reachable from either one, but
exclude anything that is reachable from both of them".</p><p>Please note that these range notation can be used with both gitk
and "git log".</p><p>After inspecting what Bob did, if there is nothing urgent, Alice may
decide to continue working without pulling from Bob.  If Bob's history
does have something Alice would immediately need, Alice may choose to
stash her work-in-progress first, do a "pull", and then finally unstash
her work-in-progress on top of the resulting history.</p><p>When you are working in a small closely knit group, it is not
unusual to interact with the same repository over and over
again.  By defining <span class="emphasis"><em>remote</em></span> repository shorthand, you can make
it easier:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git remote add bob /home/bob/myrepo</pre><p>With this, Alice can perform the first part of the "pull" operation
alone using the <span class="emphasis"><em>git fetch</em></span> command without merging them with her own
branch, using:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git fetch bob</pre><p>Unlike the longhand form, when Alice fetches from Bob using a
remote repository shorthand set up with <span class="emphasis"><em>git remote</em></span>, what was
fetched is stored in a remote-tracking branch, in this case
<span class="emphasis"><em>bob/master</em></span>.  So after this:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git log -p master..bob/master</pre><p>shows a list of all the changes that Bob made since he branched from
Alice's master branch.</p><p>After examining those changes, Alice
could merge the changes into her master branch:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git merge bob/master</pre><p>This <span class="emphasis"><em>merge</em></span> can also be done by <span class="emphasis"><em>pulling from her own remote-tracking
branch</em></span>, like this:</p><pre class="screen">alice$ git pull . remotes/bob/master</pre><p>Note that git pull always merges into the current branch,
regardless of what else is given on the command line.</p><p>Later, Bob can update his repo with Alice's latest changes using</p><pre class="screen">bob$ git pull</pre><p>Note that he doesn't need to give the path to Alice's repository;
when Bob cloned Alice's repository, git stored the location of her
repository in the repository configuration, and that location is
used for pulls:</p><pre class="screen">bob$ git config --get remote.origin.url
/home/alice/project</pre><p>(The complete configuration created by <span class="emphasis"><em>git clone</em></span> is visible using
<span class="emphasis"><em>git config -l</em></span>, and the <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-config(1)" title="G.3.25. git-config(1)">Section G.3.25, &#8220;git-config(1)&#8221;</a> man page
explains the meaning of each option.)</p><p>Git also keeps a pristine copy of Alice's master branch under the
name "origin/master":</p><pre class="screen">bob$ git branch -r
  origin/master</pre><p>If Bob later decides to work from a different host, he can still
perform clones and pulls using the ssh protocol:</p><pre class="screen">bob$ git clone alice.org:/home/alice/project myrepo</pre><p>Alternatively, git has a native protocol, or can use rsync or http;
see <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-pull(1)" title="G.3.94. git-pull(1)">Section G.3.94, &#8220;git-pull(1)&#8221;</a> for details.</p><p>Git can also be used in a CVS-like mode, with a central repository
that various users push changes to; see <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-push(1)" title="G.3.95. git-push(1)">Section G.3.95, &#8220;git-push(1)&#8221;</a> and
<a class="xref" href="Git-Tutorial.html#gitcvs-migration(7)" title="G.2.4. gitcvs-migration(7)">Section G.2.4, &#8220;gitcvs-migration(7)&#8221;</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Exploring history"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__exploring_history"></a>Exploring history</h4></div></div></div><p>Git history is represented as a series of interrelated commits.  We
have already seen that the <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span> command can list those commits.
Note that first line of each git log entry also gives a name for the
commit:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log
commit c82a22c39cbc32576f64f5c6b3f24b99ea8149c7
Author: Junio C Hamano &lt;junkio@cox.net&gt;
Date:   Tue May 16 17:18:22 2006 -0700

    merge-base: Clarify the comments on post processing.</pre><p>We can give this name to <span class="emphasis"><em>git show</em></span> to see the details about this
commit.</p><pre class="screen">$ git show c82a22c39cbc32576f64f5c6b3f24b99ea8149c7</pre><p>But there are other ways to refer to commits.  You can use any initial
part of the name that is long enough to uniquely identify the commit:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show c82a22c39c   # the first few characters of the name are
                        # usually enough
$ git show HEAD         # the tip of the current branch
$ git show experimental # the tip of the "experimental" branch</pre><p>Every commit usually has one "parent" commit
which points to the previous state of the project:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show HEAD^  # to see the parent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD^^ # to see the grandparent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD~4 # to see the great-great grandparent of HEAD</pre><p>Note that merge commits may have more than one parent:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show HEAD^1 # show the first parent of HEAD (same as HEAD^)
$ git show HEAD^2 # show the second parent of HEAD</pre><p>You can also give commits names of your own; after running</p><pre class="screen">$ git tag v2.5 1b2e1d63ff</pre><p>you can refer to 1b2e1d63ff by the name "v2.5".  If you intend to
share this name with other people (for example, to identify a release
version), you should create a "tag" object, and perhaps sign it; see
<a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-tag(1)" title="G.3.135. git-tag(1)">Section G.3.135, &#8220;git-tag(1)&#8221;</a> for details.</p><p>Any git command that needs to know a commit can take any of these
names.  For example:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff v2.5 HEAD     # compare the current HEAD to v2.5
$ git branch stable v2.5 # start a new branch named "stable" based
                         # at v2.5
$ git reset --hard HEAD^ # reset your current branch and working
                         # directory to its state at HEAD^</pre><p>Be careful with that last command: in addition to losing any changes
in the working directory, it will also remove all later commits from
this branch.  If this branch is the only branch containing those
commits, they will be lost.  Also, don't use <span class="emphasis"><em>git reset</em></span> on a
publicly-visible branch that other developers pull from, as it will
force needless merges on other developers to clean up the history.
If you need to undo changes that you have pushed, use <span class="emphasis"><em>git revert</em></span>
instead.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>git grep</em></span> command can search for strings in any version of your
project, so</p><pre class="screen">$ git grep "hello" v2.5</pre><p>searches for all occurrences of "hello" in v2.5.</p><p>If you leave out the commit name, <span class="emphasis"><em>git grep</em></span> will search any of the
files it manages in your current directory.  So</p><pre class="screen">$ git grep "hello"</pre><p>is a quick way to search just the files that are tracked by git.</p><p>Many git commands also take sets of commits, which can be specified
in a number of ways.  Here are some examples with <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log v2.5..v2.6            # commits between v2.5 and v2.6
$ git log v2.5..                # commits since v2.5
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log v2.5.. Makefile       # commits since v2.5 which modify
                                # Makefile</pre><p>You can also give <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span> a "range" of commits where the first is not
necessarily an ancestor of the second; for example, if the tips of
the branches "stable" and "master" diverged from a common
commit some time ago, then</p><pre class="screen">$ git log stable..master</pre><p>will list commits made in the master branch but not in the
stable branch, while</p><pre class="screen">$ git log master..stable</pre><p>will show the list of commits made on the stable branch but not
the master branch.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span> command has a weakness: it must present commits in a
list.  When the history has lines of development that diverged and
then merged back together, the order in which <span class="emphasis"><em>git log</em></span> presents
those commits is meaningless.</p><p>Most projects with multiple contributors (such as the Linux kernel,
or git itself) have frequent merges, and <span class="emphasis"><em>gitk</em></span> does a better job of
visualizing their history.  For example,</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk --since="2 weeks ago" drivers/</pre><p>allows you to browse any commits from the last 2 weeks of commits
that modified files under the "drivers" directory.  (Note: you can
adjust gitk's fonts by holding down the control key while pressing
"-" or "+".)</p><p>Finally, most commands that take filenames will optionally allow you
to precede any filename by a commit, to specify a particular version
of the file:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff v2.5:Makefile HEAD:Makefile.in</pre><p>You can also use <span class="emphasis"><em>git show</em></span> to see any such file:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show v2.5:Makefile</pre></div><div class="simplesect" title="Next Steps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial(7)__next_steps"></a>Next Steps</h4></div></div></div><p>This tutorial should be enough to perform basic distributed revision
control for your projects.  However, to fully understand the depth
and power of git you need to understand two simple ideas on which it
is based:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
The object database is the rather elegant system used to
    store the history of your project--files, directories, and
    commits.
</li><li class="listitem">
The index file is a cache of the state of a directory tree,
    used to create commits, check out working directories, and
    hold the various trees involved in a merge.
</li></ul></div><p>Part two of this tutorial explains the object
database, the index file, and a few other odds and ends that you'll
need to make the most of git. You can find it at <a class="xref" href="Git-Tutorial.html#gittutorial-2(7)" title="G.2.2. gittutorial-2(7)">Section G.2.2, &#8220;gittutorial-2(7)&#8221;</a>.</p><p>If you don't want to continue with that right away, a few other

It turns out that every object in the git history is stored under
a 40-digit hex name.  That name is the SHA1 hash of the object's
contents; among other things, this ensures that git will never store
the same data twice (since identical data is given an identical SHA1
name), and that the contents of a git object will never change (since
that would change the object's name as well). The 7 char hex strings
here are simply the abbreviation of such 40 character long strings.
Abbreviations can be used everywhere where the 40 character strings
can be used, so long as they are unambiguous.</p><p>It is expected that the content of the commit object you created while
following the example above generates a different SHA1 hash than
the one shown above because the commit object records the time when
it was created and the name of the person performing the commit.</p><p>We can ask git about this particular object with the <span class="emphasis"><em>cat-file</em></span>
command. Don't copy the 40 hex digits from this example but use those
from your own version. Note that you can shorten it to only a few
characters to save yourself typing all 40 hex digits:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file -t 54196cc2

initial commit</pre><p>A tree can refer to one or more "blob" objects, each corresponding to
a file.  In addition, a tree can also refer to other tree objects,
thus creating a directory hierarchy.  You can examine the contents of
any tree using ls-tree (remember that a long enough initial portion
of the SHA1 will also work):</p><pre class="screen">$ git ls-tree 92b8b694
100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad    file.txt</pre><p>Thus we see that this tree has one file in it.  The SHA1 hash is a
reference to that file's data:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file -t 3b18e512
blob</pre><p>A "blob" is just file data, which we can also examine with cat-file:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file blob 3b18e512
hello world</pre><p>Note that this is the old file data; so the object that git named in
its response to the initial tree was a tree with a snapshot of the
directory state that was recorded by the first commit.</p><p>All of these objects are stored under their SHA1 names inside the git
directory:</p><pre class="screen">$ find .git/objects/

initial commit</pre><p>The tree object is the tree we examined first, and this commit is
unusual in that it lacks any parent.</p><p>Most commits have only one parent, but it is also common for a commit
to have multiple parents.   In that case the commit represents a
merge, with the parent references pointing to the heads of the merged
branches.</p><p>Besides blobs, trees, and commits, the only remaining type of object
is a "tag", which we won't discuss here; refer to <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-tag(1)" title="G.3.135. git-tag(1)">Section G.3.135, &#8220;git-tag(1)&#8221;</a>
for details.</p><p>So now we know how git uses the object database to represent a
project's history:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
"commit" objects refer to "tree" objects representing the
    snapshot of a directory tree at a particular point in the
    history, and refer to "parent" commits to show how they're
    connected into the project history.
</li><li class="listitem">
"tree" objects represent the state of a single directory,
    associating directory names to "blob" objects containing file
    data and "tree" objects containing subdirectory information.
</li><li class="listitem">
"blob" objects contain file data without any other structure.
</li><li class="listitem">
References to commit objects at the head of each branch are
    stored in files under .git/refs/heads/.
</li><li class="listitem">
The name of the current branch is stored in .git/HEAD.
</li></ul></div><p>Note, by the way, that lots of commands take a tree as an argument.
But as we can see above, a tree can be referred to in many different
ways--by the SHA1 name for that tree, by the name of a commit that
refers to the tree, by the name of a branch whose head refers to that
tree, etc.--and most such commands can accept any of these names.</p><p>In command synopses, the word "tree-ish" is sometimes used to
designate such an argument.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="The index file"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gittutorial-2(7)__the_index_file"></a>The index file</h4></div></div></div><p>The primary tool we've been using to create commits is <span class="emphasis"><em>git-commit
-a</em></span>, which creates a commit including every change you've made to
your working tree.  But what if you want to commit changes only to
certain files?  Or only certain changes to certain files?</p><p>If we look at the way commits are created under the cover, we'll see
that there are more flexible ways creating commits.</p><p>Continuing with our test-project, let's modify file.txt again:</p><pre class="screen">$ echo "hello world, again" &gt;&gt;file.txt</pre><p>but this time instead of immediately making the commit, let's take an
intermediate step, and ask for diffs along the way to keep track of
what's happening:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff

#
#       modified: file.txt
#</pre><p>Since the current state of closing.txt is cached in the index file,
it is listed as "Changes to be committed".  Since file.txt has
changes in the working directory that aren't reflected in the index,
it is marked "changed but not updated".  At this point, running "git
commit" would create a commit that added closing.txt (with its new
contents), but that didn't modify file.txt.</p><p>Also, note that a bare <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff</em></span> shows the changes to file.txt, but
not the addition of closing.txt, because the version of closing.txt
in the index file is identical to the one in the working directory.</p><p>In addition to being the staging area for new commits, the index file
is also populated from the object database when checking out a
branch, and is used to hold the trees involved in a merge operation.

out empty, and the only thing you need to do is find yourself a
subdirectory that you want to use as a working tree - either an empty
one for a totally new project, or an existing working tree that you want
to import into git.</p><p>For our first example, we're going to start a totally new repository from
scratch, with no pre-existing files, and we'll call it <span class="emphasis"><em>git-tutorial</em></span>.
To start up, create a subdirectory for it, change into that
subdirectory, and initialize the git infrastructure with <span class="emphasis"><em>git init</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir git-tutorial
$ cd git-tutorial
$ git init</pre><p>to which git will reply</p><pre class="screen">Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</pre><p>which is just git's way of saying that you haven't been doing anything
strange, and that it will have created a local <span class="emphasis"><em>.git</em></span> directory setup for
your new project. You will now have a <span class="emphasis"><em>.git</em></span> directory, and you can
inspect that with <span class="emphasis"><em>ls</em></span>. For your new empty project, it should show you
three entries, among other things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">

</p><p class="simpara">Don't worry about the fact that the file that the <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span> link points to

why the <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/HEAD</em></span> file was created points to it even if it

point to the branch you are working on right now, and you always
start out expecting to work on the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch.</p><p>However, this is only a convention, and you can name your branches

few trivial files just to get a feel for it.</p><p>Start off with just creating any random files that you want to maintain
in your git repository. We'll start off with a few bad examples, just to
get a feel for how this works:</p><pre class="screen">$ echo "Hello World" &gt;hello
$ echo "Silly example" &gt;example</pre><p>you have now created two files in your working tree (aka <span class="emphasis"><em>working directory</em></span>),
but to actually check in your hard work, you will have to go through two steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
fill in the <span class="emphasis"><em>index</em></span> file (aka <span class="emphasis"><em>cache</em></span>) with the information about your
   working tree state.
</li><li class="listitem">
commit that index file as an object.
</li></ul></div><p>The first step is trivial: when you want to tell git about any changes
to your working tree, you use the <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index</em></span> program. That
program normally just takes a list of filenames you want to update, but
to avoid trivial mistakes, it refuses to add new entries to the index
(or remove existing ones) unless you explicitly tell it that you're
adding a new entry with the <span class="emphasis"><em>--add</em></span> flag (or removing an entry with the
<span class="emphasis"><em>--remove</em></span>) flag.</p><p>So to populate the index with the two files you just created, you can do</p><pre class="screen">$ git update-index --add hello example</pre><p>and you have now told git to track those two files.</p><p>In fact, as you did that, if you now look into your object directory,
you'll notice that git will have added two new objects to the object
database. If you did exactly the steps above, you should now be able to do</p><pre class="screen">$ ls .git/objects/??/*</pre><p>and see two files:</p><pre class="screen">.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
.git/objects/f2/4c74a2e500f5ee1332c86b94199f52b1d1d962</pre><p>which correspond with the objects with names of <span class="emphasis"><em>557db...</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>f24c7...</em></span> respectively.</p><p>If you want to, you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>git cat-file</em></span> to look at those objects, but
you'll have to use the object name, not the filename of the object:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file -t 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238</pre><p>where the <span class="emphasis"><em>-t</em></span> tells <span class="emphasis"><em>git cat-file</em></span> to tell you what the "type" of the
object is. git will tell you that you have a "blob" object (i.e., just a
regular file), and you can see the contents with</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file blob 557db03</pre><p>which will print out "Hello World". The object <span class="emphasis"><em>557db03</em></span> is nothing
more than the contents of your file <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Don't confuse that object with the file <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> itself.

look at the objects themselves, and typing long 40-character hex
names is not something you'd normally want to do. The above digression
was just to show that <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index</em></span> did something magical, and
actually saved away the contents of your files into the git object
database.</p><p>Updating the index did something else too: it created a <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/index</em></span>
file. This is the index that describes your current working tree, and
something you should be very aware of. Again, you normally never worry
about the index file itself, but you should be aware of the fact that
you have not actually really "checked in" your files into git so far,
you've only <span class="strong"><strong>told</strong></span> git about them.</p><p>However, since git knows about them, you can now start using some of the
most basic git commands to manipulate the files or look at their status.</p><p>In particular, let's not even check in the two files into git yet, we'll
start off by adding another line to <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> first:</p><pre class="screen">$ echo "It's a new day for git" &gt;&gt;hello</pre><p>and you can now, since you told git about the previous state of <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>, ask
git what has changed in the tree compared to your old index, using the
<span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files</em></span> command:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff-files</pre><p>Oops. That wasn't very readable. It just spit out its own internal
version of a <span class="emphasis"><em>diff</em></span>, but that internal version really just tells you
that it has noticed that "hello" has been modified, and that the old object
contents it had have been replaced with something else.</p><p>To make it readable, we can tell <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files</em></span> to output the
differences as a patch, using the <span class="emphasis"><em>-p</em></span> flag:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff-files -p

that git knows about in the index, and commit them as a real tree. We do
that in two phases: creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>tree</em></span> object, and committing that <span class="emphasis"><em>tree</em></span>
object as a <span class="emphasis"><em>commit</em></span> object together with an explanation of what the
tree was all about, along with information of how we came to that state.</p><p>Creating a tree object is trivial, and is done with <span class="emphasis"><em>git write-tree</em></span>.
There are no options or other input: <span class="emphasis"><em>git write-tree</em></span> will take the
current index state, and write an object that describes that whole
index. In other words, we're now tying together all the different
filenames with their contents (and their permissions), and we're
creating the equivalent of a git "directory" object:</p><pre class="screen">$ git write-tree</pre><p>and this will just output the name of the resulting tree, in this case
(if you have done exactly as I've described) it should be</p><pre class="screen">8988da15d077d4829fc51d8544c097def6644dbb</pre><p>which is another incomprehensible object name. Again, if you want to,
you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>git cat-file -t 8988d...</em></span> to see that this time the object
is not a "blob" object, but a "tree" object (you can also use
<span class="emphasis"><em>git cat-file</em></span> to actually output the raw object contents, but you'll see
mainly a binary mess, so that's less interesting).</p><p>However -- normally you'd never use <span class="emphasis"><em>git write-tree</em></span> on its own, because
normally you always commit a tree into a commit object using the
<span class="emphasis"><em>git commit-tree</em></span> command. In fact, it's easier to not actually use
<span class="emphasis"><em>git write-tree</em></span> on its own at all, but to just pass its result in as an
argument to <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit-tree</em></span>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>git commit-tree</em></span> normally takes several arguments -- it wants to know
what the <span class="emphasis"><em>parent</em></span> of a commit was, but since this is the first commit
ever in this new repository, and it has no parents, we only need to pass in
the object name of the tree. However, <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit-tree</em></span> also wants to get a
commit message on its standard input, and it will write out the resulting
object name for the commit to its standard output.</p><p>And this is where we create the <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/refs/heads/master</em></span> file
which is pointed at by <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span>. This file is supposed to contain
the reference to the top-of-tree of the master branch, and since
that's exactly what <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit-tree</em></span> spits out, we can do this
all with a sequence of simple shell commands:</p><pre class="screen">$ tree=$(git write-tree)
$ commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
$ git update-ref HEAD $commit</pre><p>In this case this creates a totally new commit that is not related to
anything else. Normally you do this only <span class="strong"><strong>once</strong></span> for a project ever, and
all later commits will be parented on top of an earlier commit.</p><p>Again, normally you'd never actually do this by hand. There is a
helpful script called <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span> that will do all of this for you. So
you could have just written <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span>
instead, and it would have done the above magic scripting for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Making a change"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__making_a_change"></a>Making a change</h4></div></div></div><p>Remember how we did the <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index</em></span> on file <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> and then we
changed <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> afterward, and could compare the new state of <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> with the
state we saved in the index file?</p><p>Further, remember how I said that <span class="emphasis"><em>git write-tree</em></span> writes the contents
of the <span class="strong"><strong>index</strong></span> file to the tree, and thus what we just committed was in
fact the <span class="strong"><strong>original</strong></span> contents of the file <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>, not the new ones. We did
that on purpose, to show the difference between the index state, and the
state in the working tree, and how they don't have to match, even
when we commit things.</p><p>As before, if we do <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files -p</em></span> in our git-tutorial project,
we'll still see the same difference we saw last time: the index file
hasn't changed by the act of committing anything. However, now that we
have committed something, we can also learn to use a new command:
<span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span>.</p><p>Unlike <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files</em></span>, which showed the difference between the index
file and the working tree, <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span> shows the differences
between a committed <span class="strong"><strong>tree</strong></span> and either the index file or the working
tree. In other words, <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span> wants a tree to be diffed
against, and before we did the commit, we couldn't do that, because we
didn't have anything to diff against.</p><p>But now we can do</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff-index -p HEAD</pre><p>(where <span class="emphasis"><em>-p</em></span> has the same meaning as it did in <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files</em></span>), and it
will show us the same difference, but for a totally different reason.
Now we're comparing the working tree not against the index file,
but against the tree we just wrote. It just so happens that those two
are obviously the same, so we get the same result.</p><p>Again, because this is a common operation, you can also just shorthand
it with</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff HEAD</pre><p>which ends up doing the above for you.</p><p>In other words, <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span> normally compares a tree against the
working tree, but when given the <span class="emphasis"><em>--cached</em></span> flag, it is told to
instead compare against just the index cache contents, and ignore the
current working tree state entirely. Since we just wrote the index
file to HEAD, doing <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index --cached -p HEAD</em></span> should thus return
an empty set of differences, and that's exactly what it does.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span> really always uses the index for its
comparisons, and saying that it compares a tree against the working
tree is thus not strictly accurate. In particular, the list of
files to compare (the "meta-data") <span class="strong"><strong>always</strong></span> comes from the index file,
regardless of whether the <span class="emphasis"><em>--cached</em></span> flag is used or not. The <span class="emphasis"><em>--cached</em></span>
flag really only determines whether the file <span class="strong"><strong>contents</strong></span> to be compared
come from the working tree or not.</p><p>This is not hard to understand, as soon as you realize that git simply
never knows (or cares) about files that it is not told about
explicitly. git will never go <span class="strong"><strong>looking</strong></span> for files to compare, it
expects you to tell it what the files are, and that's what the index
is there for.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>However, our next step is to commit the <span class="strong"><strong>change</strong></span> we did, and again, to
understand what's going on, keep in mind the difference between "working
tree contents", "index file" and "committed tree". We have changes
in the working tree that we want to commit, and we always have to
work through the index file, so the first thing we need to do is to
update the index cache:</p><pre class="screen">$ git update-index hello</pre><p>(note how we didn't need the <span class="emphasis"><em>--add</em></span> flag this time, since git knew
about the file already).</p><p>Note what happens to the different <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-*</em></span> versions here.
After we've updated <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> in the index, <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-files -p</em></span> now shows no
differences, but <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index -p HEAD</em></span> still <span class="strong"><strong>does</strong></span> show that the
current state is different from the state we committed. In fact, now
<span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-index</em></span> shows the same difference whether we use the <span class="emphasis"><em>--cached</em></span>
flag or not, since now the index is coherent with the working tree.</p><p>Now, since we've updated <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> in the index, we can commit the new
version. We could do it by writing the tree by hand again, and
committing the tree (this time we'd have to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>-p HEAD</em></span> flag to
tell commit that the HEAD was the <span class="strong"><strong>parent</strong></span> of the new commit, and that
this wasn't an initial commit any more), but you've done that once
already, so let's just use the helpful script this time:</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit</pre><p>which starts an editor for you to write the commit message and tells you
a bit about what you have done.</p><p>Write whatever message you want, and all the lines that start with <span class="emphasis"><em>#</em></span>
will be pruned out, and the rest will be used as the commit message for
the change. If you decide you don't want to commit anything after all at
this point (you can continue to edit things and update the index), you
can just leave an empty message. Otherwise <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span> will commit
the change for you.</p><p>You've now made your first real git commit. And if you're interested in
looking at what <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span> really does, feel free to investigate:
it's a few very simple shell scripts to generate the helpful (?) commit
message headers, and a few one-liners that actually do the
commit itself (<span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Inspecting Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__inspecting_changes"></a>Inspecting Changes</h4></div></div></div><p>While creating changes is useful, it's even more useful if you can tell
later what changed. The most useful command for this is another of the
<span class="emphasis"><em>diff</em></span> family, namely <span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-tree</em></span>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>git diff-tree</em></span> can be given two arbitrary trees, and it will tell you the
differences between them. Perhaps even more commonly, though, you can
give it just a single commit object, and it will figure out the parent
of that commit itself, and show the difference directly. Thus, to get
the same diff that we've already seen several times, we can now do</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff-tree -p HEAD</pre><p>(again, <span class="emphasis"><em>-p</em></span> means to show the difference as a human-readable patch),

it in the <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/refs/tags/</em></span> subdirectory instead of calling it a <span class="emphasis"><em>head</em></span>.

file, after which point you can then use this symbolic name for that
particular state. You can, for example, do</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff my-first-tag</pre><p>to diff your current state against that tag which at this point will
obviously be an empty diff, but if you continue to develop and commit
stuff, you can use your tag as an "anchor-point" to see what has changed
since you tagged it.</p><p>An "annotated tag" is actually a real git object, and contains not only a
pointer to the state you want to tag, but also a small tag name and
message, along with optionally a PGP signature that says that yes,

that tag. You create these annotated tags with either the <span class="emphasis"><em>-a</em></span> or

like that, while the light-weight tags are useful for any marking you
want to do -- any time you decide that you want to remember a certain
point, just create a private tag for it, and you have a nice symbolic
name for the state at that point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Copying repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__copying_repositories"></a>Copying repositories</h4></div></div></div><p>git repositories are normally totally self-sufficient and relocatable.
Unlike CVS, for example, there is no separate notion of

the directory that it tracks, but we'll ignore that for now: it's not
how normal projects work, and it's really only meant for special uses.
So the mental model of "the git information is always tied directly to
the working tree that it describes" may not be technically 100%
accurate, but it's a good model for all normal use.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>This has two implications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
if you grow bored with the tutorial repository you created (or you've
   made a mistake and want to start all over), you can just do simple
</p><pre class="screen">$ rm -rf git-tutorial</pre><p class="simpara">and it will be gone. There's no external repository, and there's no
history outside the project you created.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
if you want to move or duplicate a git repository, you can do so. There
   is <span class="emphasis"><em>git clone</em></span> command, but if all you want to do is just to
   create a copy of your repository (with all the full history that
   went along with it), you can do so with a regular
   <span class="emphasis"><em>cp -a git-tutorial new-git-tutorial</em></span>.
</p><p class="simpara">Note that when you've moved or copied a git repository, your git index
file (which caches various information, notably some of the "stat"
information for the files involved) will likely need to be refreshed.
So after you do a <span class="emphasis"><em>cp -a</em></span> to create a new copy, you'll want to do</p><pre class="screen">$ git update-index --refresh</pre><p class="simpara">in the new repository to make sure that the index file is up-to-date.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the second point is true even across machines. You can
duplicate a remote git repository with <span class="strong"><strong>any</strong></span> regular copy mechanism, be it
<span class="emphasis"><em>scp</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>rsync</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>wget</em></span>.</p><p>When copying a remote repository, you'll want to at a minimum update the
index cache when you do this, and especially with other peoples'
repositories you often want to make sure that the index cache is in some
known state (you don't know <span class="strong"><strong>what</strong></span> they've done and not yet checked in),
so usually you'll precede the <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index</em></span> with a</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree --reset HEAD
$ git update-index --refresh</pre><p>which will force a total index re-build from the tree pointed to by <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span>.
It resets the index contents to <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span>, and then the <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index</em></span>
makes sure to match up all index entries with the checked-out files.
If the original repository had uncommitted changes in its
working tree, <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index --refresh</em></span> notices them and
tells you they need to be updated.</p><p>The above can also be written as simply</p><pre class="screen">$ git reset</pre><p>and in fact a lot of the common git command combinations can be scripted
with the <span class="emphasis"><em>git xyz</em></span> interfaces.  You can learn things by just looking
at what the various git scripts do.  For example, <span class="emphasis"><em>git reset</em></span> used to be
the above two lines implemented in <span class="emphasis"><em>git reset</em></span>, but some things like
<span class="emphasis"><em>git status</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span> are slightly more complex scripts around
the basic git commands.</p><p>Many (most?) public remote repositories will not contain any of
the checked out files or even an index file, and will <span class="strong"><strong>only</strong></span> contain the
actual core git files. Such a repository usually doesn't even have the
<span class="emphasis"><em>.git</em></span> subdirectory, but has all the git files directly in the
repository.</p><p>To create your own local live copy of such a "raw" git repository, you'd
first create your own subdirectory for the project, and then copy the
raw repository contents into the <span class="emphasis"><em>.git</em></span> directory. For example, to
create your own copy of the git repository, you'd do the following</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir my-git
$ cd my-git
$ rsync -rL rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ .git</pre><p>followed by</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree HEAD</pre><p>to populate the index. However, now you have populated the index, and
you have all the git internal files, but you will notice that you don't
actually have any of the working tree files to work on. To get
those, you'd check them out with</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout-index -u -a</pre><p>where the <span class="emphasis"><em>-u</em></span> flag means that you want the checkout to keep the index
up-to-date (so that you don't have to refresh it afterward), and the
<span class="emphasis"><em>-a</em></span> flag means "check out all files" (if you have a stale copy or an
older version of a checked out tree you may also need to add the <span class="emphasis"><em>-f</em></span>
flag first, to tell <span class="emphasis"><em>git checkout-index</em></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>force</strong></span> overwriting of any old
files).</p><p>Again, this can all be simplified with</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ my-git
$ cd my-git
$ git checkout</pre><p>which will end up doing all of the above for you.</p><p>You have now successfully copied somebody else's (mine) remote
repository, and checked it out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Creating a new branch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__creating_a_new_branch"></a>Creating a new branch</h4></div></div></div><p>Branches in git are really nothing more than pointers into the git
object database from within the <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/refs/</em></span> subdirectory, and as we
already discussed, the <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span> branch is nothing but a symlink to one of
these object pointers.</p><p>You can at any time create a new branch by just picking an arbitrary
point in the project history, and just writing the SHA1 name of that
object into a file under <span class="emphasis"><em>.git/refs/heads/</em></span>. You can use any filename you
want (and indeed, subdirectories), but the convention is that the
"normal" branch is called <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span>. That's just a convention, though,
and nothing enforces it.</p><p>To show that as an example, let's go back to the git-tutorial repository we
used earlier, and create a branch in it. You do that by simply just
saying that you want to check out a new branch:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout -b mybranch</pre><p>will create a new branch based at the current <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span> position, and switch
to it.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>If you make the decision to start your new branch at some
other point in the history than the current <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span>, you can do so by
just telling <span class="emphasis"><em>git checkout</em></span> what the base of the checkout would be.
In other words, if you have an earlier tag or branch, you'd just do</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout -b mybranch earlier-commit</pre><p>and it would create the new branch <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> at the earlier commit,
and check out the state at that time.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>You can always just jump back to your original <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch by doing</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout master</pre><p>(or any other branch-name, for that matter) and if you forget which
branch you happen to be on, a simple</p><pre class="screen">$ cat .git/HEAD</pre><p>will tell you where it's pointing.  To get the list of branches
you have, you can say</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch</pre><p>which used to be nothing more than a simple script around <span class="emphasis"><em>ls .git/refs/heads</em></span>.
There will be an asterisk in front of the branch you are currently on.</p><p>Sometimes you may wish to create a new branch <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> actually
checking it out and switching to it. If so, just use the command</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch &lt;branchname&gt; [startingpoint]</pre><p>which will simply <span class="emphasis"><em>create</em></span> the branch, but will not do anything further.
You can then later -- once you decide that you want to actually develop
on that branch -- switch to that branch with a regular <span class="emphasis"><em>git checkout</em></span>
with the branchname as the argument.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Merging two branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__merging_two_branches"></a>Merging two branches</h4></div></div></div><p>One of the ideas of having a branch is that you do some (possibly
experimental) work in it, and eventually merge it back to the main
branch. So assuming you created the above <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> that started out
being the same as the original <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch, let's make sure we're in
that branch, and do some work there.</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout mybranch
$ echo "Work, work, work" &gt;&gt;hello
$ git commit -m "Some work." -i hello</pre><p>Here, we just added another line to <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>, and we used a shorthand for
doing both <span class="emphasis"><em>git update-index hello</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span> by just giving the
filename directly to <span class="emphasis"><em>git commit</em></span>, with an <span class="emphasis"><em>-i</em></span> flag (it tells
git to <span class="emphasis"><em>include</em></span> that file in addition to what you have done to
the index file so far when making the commit).  The <span class="emphasis"><em>-m</em></span> flag is to give the
commit log message from the command line.</p><p>Now, to make it a bit more interesting, let's assume that somebody else
does some work in the original branch, and simulate that by going back
to the master branch, and editing the same file differently there:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout master</pre><p>Here, take a moment to look at the contents of <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>, and notice how they
don't contain the work we just did in <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> -- because that work
hasn't happened in the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch at all. Then do</p><pre class="screen">$ echo "Play, play, play" &gt;&gt;hello
$ echo "Lots of fun" &gt;&gt;example
$ git commit -m "Some fun." -i hello example</pre><p>since the master branch is obviously in a much better mood.</p><p>Now, you've got two branches, and you decide that you want to merge the
work done. Before we do that, let's introduce a cool graphical tool that
helps you view what's going on:</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk --all</pre><p>will show you graphically both of your branches (that's what the <span class="emphasis"><em>--all</em></span>
means: normally it will just show you your current <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span>) and their
histories. You can also see exactly how they came to be from a common
source.</p><p>Anyway, let's exit <span class="emphasis"><em>gitk</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>^Q</em></span> or the File menu), and decide that we want
to merge the work we did on the <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> branch into the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span>
branch (which is currently our <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span> too). To do that, there's a nice
script called <span class="emphasis"><em>git merge</em></span>, which wants to know which branches you want
to resolve and what the merge is all about:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge -m "Merge work in mybranch" mybranch</pre><p>where the first argument is going to be used as the commit message if
the merge can be resolved automatically.</p><p>Now, in this case we've intentionally created a situation where the
merge will need to be fixed up by hand, though, so git will do as much
of it as it can automatically (which in this case is just merge the <span class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span>
file, which had no differences in the <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> branch), and say:</p><pre class="screen">        Auto-merging hello
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre><p>It tells you that it did an "Automatic merge", which
failed due to conflicts in <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span>.</p><p>Not to worry. It left the (trivial) conflict in <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> in the same form you
should already be well used to if you've ever used CVS, so let's just
open <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> in our editor (whatever that may be), and fix it up somehow.
I'd suggest just making it so that <span class="emphasis"><em>hello</em></span> contains all four lines:</p><pre class="screen">Hello World
It's a new day for git
Play, play, play
Work, work, work</pre><p>and once you're happy with your manual merge, just do a</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit -i hello</pre><p>which will very loudly warn you that you're now committing a merge
(which is correct, so never mind), and you can write a small merge
message about your adventures in <span class="emphasis"><em>git merge</em></span>-land.</p><p>After you're done, start up <span class="emphasis"><em>gitk --all</em></span> to see graphically what the
history looks like. Notice that <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> still exists, and you can
switch to it, and continue to work with it if you want to. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span> branch will not contain the merge, but next time you merge it
from the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch, git will know how you merged it, so you'll not
have to do <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> merge again.</p><p>Another useful tool, especially if you do not always work in X-Window
environment, is <span class="emphasis"><em>git show-branch</em></span>.</p><pre class="screen">$ git show-branch --topo-order --more=1 master mybranch

with the titles of their top-of-the-tree commits, you are currently on
<span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch (notice the asterisk <span class="emphasis"><em>*</em></span> character), and the first
column for the later output lines is used to show commits contained in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch, and the second column for the <span class="emphasis"><em>mybranch</em></span>
branch. Three commits are shown along with their titles.
All of them have non blank characters in the first column (<span class="emphasis"><em>*</em></span>
shows an ordinary commit on the current branch, <span class="emphasis"><em>-</em></span> is a merge commit), which
means they are now part of the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> branch. Only the "Some

algorithm.  First, it finds the common ancestor between them.
The command it uses is <span class="emphasis"><em>git merge-base</em></span>:</p><pre class="screen">$ mb=$(git merge-base HEAD mybranch)</pre><p>The command writes the commit object name of the common ancestor
to the standard output, so we captured its output to a variable,
because we will be using it in the next step.  By the way, the common
ancestor commit is the "Initial commit" commit in this case.  You can
tell it by:</p><pre class="screen">$ git name-rev --name-only --tags $mb
my-first-tag</pre><p>After finding out a common ancestor commit, the second step is
this:</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree -m -u $mb HEAD mybranch</pre><p>This is the same <span class="emphasis"><em>git read-tree</em></span> command we have already seen,
but it takes three trees, unlike previous examples.  This reads
the contents of each tree into different <span class="emphasis"><em>stage</em></span> in the index
file (the first tree goes to stage 1, the second to stage 2,
etc.).  After reading three trees into three stages, the paths
that are the same in all three stages are <span class="emphasis"><em>collapsed</em></span> into stage
0.  Also paths that are the same in two of three stages are
collapsed into stage 0, taking the SHA1 from either stage 2 or
stage 3, whichever is different from stage 1 (i.e. only one side
changed from the common ancestor).</p><p>After <span class="emphasis"><em>collapsing</em></span> operation, paths that are different in three
trees are left in non-zero stages.  At this point, you can
inspect the index file with this command:</p><pre class="screen">$ git ls-files --stage

files so only <span class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span> resulted in collapsing.  But in real-life
large projects, when only a small number of files change in one commit,
this <span class="emphasis"><em>collapsing</em></span> tends to trivially merge most of the paths
fairly quickly, leaving only a handful of real changes in non-zero
stages.</p><p>To look at only non-zero stages, use <span class="emphasis"><em>--unmerged</em></span> flag:</p><pre class="screen">$ git ls-files --unmerged

file, using 3-way merge.  This is done by giving
<span class="emphasis"><em>git merge-one-file</em></span> command as one of the arguments to

ERROR: Merge conflict in hello
fatal: merge program failed</pre><p><span class="emphasis"><em>git merge-one-file</em></span> script is called with parameters to

merge results in the working tree.
It is a fairly straightforward shell script, and
eventually calls <span class="emphasis"><em>merge</em></span> program from RCS suite to perform a
file-level 3-way merge.  In this case, <span class="emphasis"><em>merge</em></span> detects
conflicts, and the merge result with conflict marks is left in

same if there are more than two branches.  Let's say you started
out from "master" head, and have some new code in the "master"

"diff-fix" branches:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show-branch

first and the other next, when what you have are a set of truly
independent changes (if the order mattered, then they are not
independent by definition).  You could instead merge those two
branches into the current branch at once.  First let's undo what
we just did and start over.  We would want to get the master

is a valid thing to do and often makes it easier to view the
commit history if you are merging more than two independent
changes at the same time.  However, if you have merge conflicts
with any of the branches you are merging in and need to hand
resolve, that is an indication that the development happened in
those branches were not independent after all, and you should
merge two at a time, documenting how you resolved the conflicts,
and the reason why you preferred changes made in one side over
the other.  Otherwise it would make the project history harder
to follow, not easier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="SEE ALSO"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcore-tutorial(7)__see_also"></a>SEE ALSO</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="Git-Tutorial.html#gittutorial(7)" title="G.2.1. gittutorial(7)">Section G.2.1, &#8220;gittutorial(7)&#8221;</a>,

a full copy of the project history, and no repository is inherently more
important than any other.  However, you can emulate the CVS model by
designating a single shared repository which people can synchronize with;
this document explains how to do that.</p><p>Some basic familiarity with git is required. Having gone through

foo.com.  Then as an individual committer you can clone the shared
repository over ssh with:</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone foo.com:/pub/repo.git/ my-project
$ cd my-project</pre><p>and hack away.  The equivalent of <span class="emphasis"><em>cvs update</em></span> is</p><pre class="screen">$ git pull origin</pre><p>which merges in any work that others might have done since the clone
operation.  If there are uncommitted changes in your working tree, commit
them first before running git pull.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>pull</em></span> command knows where to get updates from because of certain

updated the repository more recently, <span class="emphasis"><em>git push</em></span>, like <span class="emphasis"><em>cvs commit</em></span>, will
complain, in which case you must pull any changes before attempting the

to update (<span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span>).  If we leave that out, <span class="emphasis"><em>git push</em></span> tries to update
any branches in the remote repository that have the same name as a branch
in the local repository.  So the last <span class="emphasis"><em>push</em></span> can be done with either of:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push origin
$ git push foo.com:/pub/project.git/</pre><p>as long as the shared repository does not have any branches

possibly created from scratch or from a tarball (see
<a class="xref" href="Git-Tutorial.html#gittutorial(7)" title="G.2.1. gittutorial(7)">Section G.2.1, &#8220;gittutorial(7)&#8221;</a>), or imported from an already existing CVS
repository (see the next section).</p><p>Assume your existing repo is at /home/alice/myproject.  Create a new "bare"
repository (a repository without a working tree) and fetch your project into
it:</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir /pub/my-repo.git
$ cd /pub/my-repo.git
$ git --bare init --shared
$ git --bare fetch /home/alice/myproject master:master</pre><p>Next, give every team member read/write access to this repository.  One
easy way to do this is to give all the team members ssh access to the
machine where the repository is hosted.  If you don't want to give them a
full shell on the machine, there is a restricted shell which only allows
users to do git pushes and pulls; see <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-shell(1)" title="G.3.122. git-shell(1)">Section G.3.122, &#8220;git-shell(1)&#8221;</a>.</p><p>Put all the committers in the same group, and make the repository
writable by that group:</p><pre class="screen">$ chgrp -R $group /pub/my-repo.git</pre><p>Make sure committers have a umask of at most 027, so that the directories
they create are writable and searchable by other group members.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Importing a CVS archive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcvs-migration(7)__importing_a_cvs_archive"></a>Importing a CVS archive</h4></div></div></div><p>First, install version 2.1 or higher of cvsps from
link:http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/[<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/" target="_top">http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/</a>] and make
sure it is in your path.  Then cd to a checked out CVS working directory
of the project you are interested in and run <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-cvsimport(1)" title="G.3.32. git-cvsimport(1)">Section G.3.32, &#8220;git-cvsimport(1)&#8221;</a>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cvsimport -C &lt;destination&gt; &lt;module&gt;</pre><p>This puts a git archive of the named CVS module in the directory
&lt;destination&gt;, which will be created if necessary.</p><p>The import checks out from CVS every revision of every file.  Reportedly
cvsimport can average some twenty revisions per second, so for a
medium-sized project this should not take more than a couple of minutes.
Larger projects or remote repositories may take longer.</p><p>The main trunk is stored in the git branch named <span class="emphasis"><em>origin</em></span>, and additional
CVS branches are stored in git branches with the same names.  The most
recent version of the main trunk is also left checked out on the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span>
branch, so you can start adding your own changes right away.</p><p>The import is incremental, so if you call it again next month it will
fetch any CVS updates that have been made in the meantime.  For this to
work, you must not modify the imported branches; instead, create new
branches for your own changes, and merge in the imported branches as
necessary.</p><p>If you want a shared repository, you will need to make a bare clone
of the imported directory, as described above. Then treat the imported
directory as another development clone for purposes of merging
incremental imports.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="Advanced Shared Repository Management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcvs-migration(7)__advanced_shared_repository_management"></a>Advanced Shared Repository Management</h4></div></div></div><p>Git allows you to specify scripts called "hooks" to be run at certain
points.  You can use these, for example, to send all commits to the shared
repository to a mailing list.  See <a class="xref" href="git-misc.html#githooks(5)" title="G.4.6. githooks(5)">Section G.4.6, &#8220;githooks(5)&#8221;</a>.</p><p>You can enforce finer grained permissions using update hooks.  See

that developers can still use CVS; see <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-cvsserver(1)" title="G.3.33. git-cvsserver(1)">Section G.3.33, &#8220;git-cvsserver(1)&#8221;</a> for

a common repository.  As we've seen, this is also possible with git.
However, the distributed nature of git allows other development models,
and you may want to first consider whether one of them might be a better
fit for your project.</p><p>For example, you can choose a single person to maintain the project's
primary public repository.  Other developers then clone this repository
and each work in their own clone.  When they have a series of changes that
they're happy with, they ask the maintainer to pull from the branch
containing the changes.  The maintainer reviews their changes and pulls
them into the primary repository, which other developers pull from as
necessary to stay coordinated.  The Linux kernel and other projects use
variants of this model.</p><p>With a small group, developers may just pull changes from each other's
repositories without the need for a central maintainer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" title="SEE ALSO"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gitcvs-migration(7)__see_also"></a>SEE ALSO</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="Git-Tutorial.html#gittutorial(7)" title="G.2.1. gittutorial(7)">Section G.2.1, &#8220;gittutorial(7)&#8221;</a>,
