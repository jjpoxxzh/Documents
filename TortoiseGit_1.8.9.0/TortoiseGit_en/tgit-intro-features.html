			What makes TortoiseGit such a good Git client?
			Here's a short list of features.
		</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Shell integration</span></dt><dd><a name="id551832"></a><a name="id551840"></a><p>
						TortoiseGit integrates seamlessly into the Windows shell
						(i.e. the explorer). This means you can keep working
						with the tools you're already familiar with. And you
						do not have to change into a different application
						each time you need functions of the version control!
					</p><p>
						And you are not even forced to use the Windows Explorer.
						TortoiseGit's context menus work in many other file managers,
						and in the File/Open dialog which is common to most
						standard Windows applications.
						You should, however, bear in mind that TortoiseGit
						is intentionally developed as extension for the Windows
						Explorer. Thus it is possible that in other applications
						the integration is not as complete and e.g. the icon
						overlays may not be shown.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Icon overlays</span></dt><dd><p>
						The status of every versioned file and folder is
						indicated by small overlay icons. That way you can see
						right away what the status of your working tree is.
					</p><p>
						The icon overlays are based on TortoiseOverlays (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tortoisesvn.net/" target="_top">http://www.tortoisesvn.net</a>)
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Easy access to Git commands</span></dt><dd><p>
						All Git commands are available from the explorer
						context menu. TortoiseGit adds its own submenu there.
					</p></dd></dl></div><p>
			Since TortoiseGit is a Git client, we would also like to show you
			some of the features of Git itself:
		</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Distributed version control</span></dt><dd><p>
						 Like most other modern version control systems, Git 
						 gives each developer a local copy of the entire development 
						 history, and changes are copied from one such repository 
						 to another. These changes are imported as additional 
						 development branches, and can be merged in the same way 
						 as a locally developed branch. Repositories can be easily 
						 accessed via the efficient Git protocol (optionally wrapped 
						 in ssh for authentication and security) or simply using 
						 HTTP - you can publish your repository anywhere without 
						 any special webserver configuration required.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Atomic commits</span></dt><dd><p>
						A commit either goes into the repository completely,
						or not at all. 
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Strong support for non-linear development</span></dt><dd><p>
						Git supports rapid and convenient branching and merging, 
						and includes powerful tools for visualizing and navigating 
						a non-linear development history.					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Efficient handling of large projects</span></dt><dd><p>
						Git is very fast and scales well even when working with 
						large projects and long histories. It is commonly an order 
						of magnitude faster than most other version control systems, 
						and several orders of magnitude faster on some operations. 
						It also uses an extremely efficient packed format for long-term 
						revision storage that currently tops any other open source 
						version control system.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cryptographic authentication of history</span></dt><dd><p>
						The Git history is stored in such a way that the name of a 
						particular revision (a "commit" in Git terms) depends upon 
						the complete development history leading up to that commit. 
						Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old 
						versions without it being noticed. Also, tags can be 
						cryptographically signed. 
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Efficient branching and tagging</span></dt><dd><p>
						The cost of branching and tagging need not be
						proportional to the project size. Branch is just head of commits. 
						Tag is friend name of commit hash. 
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Toolkit design</span></dt><dd><p>
						Following the Unix tradition, Git is a collection of many small 
						tools written in C, and a number of scripts that provide convenient 
						wrappers. Git provides tools for both easy human usage and easy 
						scripting to perform new clever operations.
