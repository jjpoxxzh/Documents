		One of the commonest requirements in project development is to
		see what has changed. You might want to look at the differences
		between two revisions of the same file, or the differences between
		two separate files.
		TortoiseGit provides a built-in tool named 
		<span class="application">TortoiseGitMerge</span> for viewing differences of
		text files. For viewing differences of image files, TortoiseGit
		also has a tool named <span class="application">TortoiseGitIDiff</span>.
		Of course, you can use your own favourite diff program if you
		like.

						from the context menu.
					</p><p>
						If you want to see the difference between the last committed

						hasn't been modified, just right click on the file. Then select
						<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Diff with previous version</span>.
						This will perform a diff between the revision before
						the last-commit-date (as recorded in your working tree) and the
						working BASE. This shows you the last change made to that file
						to bring it to the state you now see in your working tree.
						It will not show changes newer than your working tree.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Difference between two previous revisions</span></dt><dd><p>

			Sometimes in the life of a project you might change the line endings

			to the meaning of the code. The options here will help to manage
			these changes when it comes to comparing and applying differences.
			You will see these settings in the <span class="guilabel">Merge</span> and

			<span class="guilabel">Ignore whitespace changes</span>
			excludes changes which are due solely to a change in the

			shown as a change.
		</p><p>
			<span class="guilabel">Ignore all whitespaces</span>
			excludes all whitespace-only changes.

			If the list of filenames is very long, you can use the search box

			The built-in diff command of git is available for diffing submodules,

		</p><p>
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="tgit-dug-submodulediff-dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.27. The submodule difference dialog</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/SubmoduleDiff.png" alt="The submodule difference dialog"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">

			for submodules will start Submodule Diff Dialog to show submodules differences. 
			The summary of the two revisions are displayed.
		</p><p>
			The 'From' group box on the top displays the information of the original revision.
			Below it, there is a 'To' group box, which display the information of the changed revision.
			For each group box, the full commit hash is displayed, and can be highlighted and copied to clipboard;
			the subject (i.e. first line of commit message) is displayed and also copyable to clipboard;
			the Show Log button brings you to a new Log Dialog and jump to that revision.
		</p><p>
			To better draw the attention of the change of revision of submodule mounted, 
			we added some indicators.
			In 'To' group box, there is a change type field. Here list out the types:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Fast-forward</span></dt><dd><p>
							Topology-based. This is for a fast-forward change.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Rewind</span></dt><dd><p>
							Topology-based. This is the reversed direction of a fast-forward change.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Newer commit time</span></dt><dd><p>
							Time-based. If it is neither fast-forward nor rewind, then we compare commit time.
							This is for a revision with newer commit time than the original revision.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Older commit time</span></dt><dd><p>
							Time-based. This is the reversal of 'Newer commit time'.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Same commit time</span></dt><dd><p>
							Time-based. The commit time is the same. 
							This may be produced by auto-generating commits or committing at the same time by two persons.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">New Submodule</span></dt><dd><p>
							This is for newly added submodule.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Delete Submodule</span></dt><dd><p>
							This is for deleted submodule.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Unknown</span></dt><dd><p>
							This is for submodule revision hash not changed, error, etc..
						</p></dd></dl></div><p>

			If current workspace of the submodule is dirty, 
			the commit hash will be rendered in yellow background and red text.
		</p><p>
			In both group boxes,
			if the revision is not fetched, submodule not initialized or other errors,
			the commit hash will be rendered in red background.

			There are many tools available for diffing text files, including our
			own TortoiseGitMerge, but we often find ourselves wanting to see how
			an image file has changed too. That's why we created TortoiseGitIDiff.
		</p><p>
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="tgit-dug-idiff-dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.28. The image difference viewer</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/TortoiseIDiff.png" alt="The image difference viewer"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Diff</span>
			for any of the common image file formats will start TortoiseGitIDiff
			to show image differences. By default the images are displayed side-by-side
			but you can use the View menu or toolbar to switch to a top-bottom
			view instead, or if you prefer, you can overlay the images and pretend
			you are using a lightbox.
		</p><p>
			Naturally you can also zoom in and out and pan around the image.
			You can also pan the image simply by left-dragging it.
			If you select the <span class="guilabel">Link images together</span> option,
			then the pan controls (scrollbars, mousewheel) on both images are linked.
		</p><p>
			An image info box shows details about the image file, such as the
			size in pixels, resolution and colour depth. If this box gets in the
			way, use
			<span class="guimenu">View</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">Image Info</span>
			to hide it.
			You can get the same information in a tooltip if you hover the mouse
			over the image title bar.
		</p><p>
			When the images are overlaid, the relative intensity of the images
			(alpha blend) is controlled by a slider control at the left side.
			You can click anywhere in the slider to set the blend directly, or you
			can drag the slider to change the blend interactively.
			<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+Shift</strong></span>-<span class="action">Wheel</span> to change the blend.
		</p><p>
			The button above the slider toggles between two preset blends, indicated
			by the markers on either side of the blend slider. By default one is at
			the top and the other at the bottom, so the toggle button just switches
			between one image and the other. You can move the markers to choose
			the two blend values that the toggle button will use.
		</p><p>
			Sometimes you want to see a difference rather than a blend. You might
			have the image files for two revisions of a printed circuit board and
			want to see which tracks have changed. If you disable alpha blend mode,
			the difference will be shown as an <span class="emphasis"><em>XOR</em></span> of the pixel
			colour values. Unchanged areas will be plain white and changes will be
			coloured.

			If the tools we	provide don't do what you need, try one of the many

		</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">WinMerge</span></dt><dd><p>

					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">ExamDiff</span></dt><dd><p>
						ExamDiff Standard is freeware. It can handle

						ExamDiff Pro is shareware and adds a number

						capability.
						In both flavours, version 3.2 and above can handle
						unicode. You can download them from
						<a class="ulink" href="http://www.prestosoft.com/" target="_top">
							<em class="citetitle">PrestoSoft</em>
						</a>.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Beyond Compare</span></dt><dd><p>
						Similar to ExamDiff Pro, this is an excellent shareware
						diff tool which can handle directory diffs and unicode.
						Download it from
						<a class="ulink" href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/" target="_top">
							<em class="citetitle">Scooter Software</em>
						</a>.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Araxis Merge</span></dt><dd><p>
						Araxis Merge is a useful commercial tool for diff and merging

						<a class="ulink" href="http://www.araxis.com/merge/index.html" target="_top">
							<em class="citetitle">Araxis</em>

							<em class="citetitle">Scintilla</em>
						</a>.
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Notepad2</span></dt><dd><p>
						Notepad2 is designed as a replacement for the standard
